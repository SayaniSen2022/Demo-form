# Semantic HTML Form Demo: Enhancing User Experience with Structured Content

It is a part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification.

## Description

A small static web page that showcases the power and significance of using semantic HTML elements to create a user-friendly and accessible web form. This demo project aims to illustrate the value of structuring web content in a meaningful way.

The form, designed with a clean and intuitive interface, represents various common input fields such as text inputs, radio buttons, checkboxes, and a dropdown menu. This approach improves the form's overall search engine optimization (SEO) and ensures enhanced accessibility for users with disabilities. Screen readers and other assistive technologies can accurately interpret the form's content, allowing for a more inclusive user experience.
